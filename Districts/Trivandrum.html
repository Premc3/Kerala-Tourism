In addition, Trivandrum is a gateway to nearby popular beach towns of Kovalam and Varkala.The Padmanabhaswamy temple (also known as Anantha Padmanabhaswamy temple) is a must-visit temple of India. Other famous temples in Trivandrum include the Attukal Bhagawati temple, the Aazhimala Siva Temple, the Karikkakom Chamundi Devi Temple, and the Pazhavangadi Ganapathy Temple.</p>
  
            <p> The city is home to a few museums, such as the Kuthiramalika Palace Museum and the Napier Museum. The Kuthiramalika Palace Museum is situated close-by to the Padmanabhaswamy temple.
